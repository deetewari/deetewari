- 👋 Hi, I’m Deependra (@deetewari). 
- 👀 I’m interested in Java, JakartaEE, Javascript, HTML, CSS, C++, CUDA/HIP, Python & Linux.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning C++ and getting grasp of CUDA, HIP (ROCm), Quarkus and MicroProfile.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects based on JakartaEE, Java, C++ and Linux. I can also contribute with QA, Testing, good documentation and community support.
